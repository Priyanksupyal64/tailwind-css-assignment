                cofounded Apple in his parent's garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned
                to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he died, in October
                2011, had built it into the world's most valuable company.
                Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal comuting, 
                animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and 
                digityal publishing. He thus belongs inthe pantheon of America's great innovators,
                along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was 
                a saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied
                imagination to technology and business.
